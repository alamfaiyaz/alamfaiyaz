### Hello, I am Faiyaz Alam
Full-stack web developer specializing in Javascript, HTML, CSS and MERN stack.

Since my school days, I was interested in computers and before my HSC results came out, I did an advanced diploma in computer application from a computer training institute. After I completed that my interest for developing web pages increased. I wanted to take up B. Tech in Computer Science and Engineering but because of financial issues I couldn't do so, that's why I took admission in B.Sc in my city but in August 2021 I heard about Masai school and gave the Masai's msat test which has three stages. I cracked that test and in October 2021- April 2022 I completed the full-stack web development course and learned all the skills that a good developer needs. Apart from technical skills, I have also developed soft skills like Time management, Problem- solving and leadership qualities.

I love learning new technologies and implementing them to solve real world problems. I am passionate about building challenging projects and excelling in their development. I am team player with effective communication and problem-solving skills.
